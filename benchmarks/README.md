# Benchmarks

[`ðŸŽ¥ Video Tutorial`](https://youtu.be/eKOZawGR3y0)

DeepFace offers various configurations that significantly impact accuracy, including the facial recognition model, face detector model, distance metric, and alignment mode. Our experiments conducted on the [LFW dataset](https://sefiks.com/2020/08/27/labeled-faces-in-the-wild-for-face-recognition/) using different combinations of these configurations yield the following results.

You can reproduce the results by executing the `Perform-Experiments.ipynb` and `Evaluate-Results.ipynb` notebooks, respectively.

## ROC Curves

ROC curves provide a valuable means of evaluating the performance of different models on a broader scale. The following illusration shows ROC curves for different facial recognition models alongside their optimal configurations yielding the highest accuracy scores.

In summary, FaceNet-512d surpasses human-level accuracy, while FaceNet-128d reaches it, with Dlib, VGG-Face, and ArcFace closely trailing but slightly below, and GhostFaceNet and SFace making notable contributions despite not leading, while OpenFace, DeepFace, and DeepId exhibit lower performance.

## Accuracy Scores

Please note that humans achieve a 97.5% accuracy score on the same dataset. Configurations that outperform this benchmark are highlighted in bold.
